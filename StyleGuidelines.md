# Introduction #

Everyone know maintaining a consistent style in a project is very important to maintain the readability and coherence of the project. This page has some guidelines which can be followed. We are not creating our own guidelines but merely following the good practices prevalent in the python community.


# Code style guidelines #

  * [PEP 8: The Python Style Guide for Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

  * [Google Python Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html)


# Docstring style guidelines #

Try to write docs in concise unambiguous words.
Here are some of the guidelines you can follow while writing docstrings.
Long docs are preferred in [ReStructured Text](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html) format. The numpy/scipy documentation format is used for docstrings instead of the default sphinx format.

  * [Numpy/Scipy Documentation Guide](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)

  * [PEP 257: Python Docstring Conventions](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

  * [PEP 287: Python reStructuredText Docstring Format](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/)
