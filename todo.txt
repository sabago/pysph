       - Add provision to remove values from *Arrays.
       - Test-cases for *Arrays.   
       - Add provision to initialize *Arrays from numpy arrays.
       - How is the standard_name_map from ParticleArray being implemented. Or
         decide if it is actually required.
       - Need to maintain a multi-level cell hierarcy of cells in the
         CellManager.
       - How does NNPS perform search using the multi-level hierarchy for cells
         ? How does one decide which hierarcy to use for a particular search.

       - Updating cell manager in a parallel implementation to be thought of.

    - a method in the ParticleArray to specify the properties it provides.
      Each property will have a standard name, using which it will be
      identified, for example 'mass', 'density' etc. With this name will be
      associated another string which will identify the name of the array that
      holds that property. So if any module wants the 'mass' array from the
      particle array, it will just query for mass, and get the array. It need
      not bother about the exact that the array is stored internall as.
